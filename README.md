<p align="center"><strong>Description</strong>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mysql has a command called <i>mysqlimport</i> which
 locally reads a text file, and stores it to existing table. However,
logging into the server and and create a table, and then type a long 
command such as <i>load data infile...</i> sometimes can be to much work.t
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This command line app reads a comma separated value (for now) with fields on first 
line, creates table, and stores values to a table in the server. 
It only needs a file with comma separated type names corresponding to 
the fields. For example, if cars.txt has three fields <i>"id, speed, dist</i>" only thing this
app need is a path to a file contains a line "<i>int,int,int</i>",
as a parameter.

2. Once rust is installed, cd into the project root, and run configure
script:  <pre> chmod  +x  configure </pre>
         <pre> ./configure  <*host*>  <*user*>  <*database*></pre>
         where *hostname* is where the input files are, *username* is your mysql
